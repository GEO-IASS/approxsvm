*** ApproxSVM ***
Approximating nonlinear SVM models with RBF kernel.

This project is a C++ implementation of a second-order Maclaurin series 
approximation of LIBSVM models using an RBF kernel. This approximation
greatly increases prediction speed for models with many support vectors
but in few dimensions. For mathematical details, please refer to the 
associated publication at:

*******************************************************************

COMPILATION

Depending on what facilities are available on your platform, several
options exist for computations. The configure script detects presence
of BLAS routines on your platform and uses them if possible. If not
available, a naive (slow) fallback implementation is used instead. If
you have ATLAS on your system, make sure to use it in the configure
stage using "--with-atlas=<PATH>".

It is strongly advised to allow the use of vector instructions using
the following compiler flag: "-march=native".

For a typical build, issue the following commands:
  ./configure CXXFLAGS="-O3 -march=native" --disable-shared
  make
  sudo make install

If you get errors about loading shared libraries, issue this command:
  sudo ldconfig

*******************************************************************

USING THE TOOLS

ApproxSVM contains two tools:
  approx-svm: used to approximate a given LIBSVM model with RBF kernel
  approx-predict: used to make predictions with an approximated model
  
For an overview of command line arguments, please execute either tool
without arguments or with "--help".
